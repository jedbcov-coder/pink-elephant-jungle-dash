## Deploy to GitHub Pages (single method)

This project uses **one deployment method only**:

- **Source:** `main` branch
- **Folder:** `/docs`
- **GitHub Actions deploy workflows:** not used for deployment

Steps:

1. Build the Pages output:

```bash
npm run build:pages
```

2. Commit and push your changes, including the updated `docs/` folder.

Notes:

- `build:pages` creates a production build directly in `docs/`.
- Deployment does **not** use GitHub Actions workflows.
- `docs/.nojekyll` must stay in the repo as an empty file.
